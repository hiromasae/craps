This is a simplified game of craps. 
The player starts with a balance of $100 and puts their bet in the pot. The bot 
bets the same amount as the player every time. The player then rolls two dice.

If you roll a 7 or 11, you win immediately.
If you roll a 2, 3, or 12, you lose immediately.
If you roll any other number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), that number becomes the 
“point.” You must continue to roll until you either roll the point number again, 
in which case you win, or you roll a 7, in which case you lose.

Then it is the bot's turn to put their bet in the pot. The player bets the same 
amount as the bot every time. The bot then rolls two dice. After the bot 
finishes their turn, the player has the option to bet and roll again.
